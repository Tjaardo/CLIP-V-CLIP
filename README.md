# CLIP-V-CLIP
This repository contains a jupyter notebook implementation of a CLIP-style model that can be used with image-caption pairs, as well as video-caption pairs.

## Usage
You can directly execute the notebook, however, you have to ensure that both the simverb-3500.csv and the annotations.txt files are in the same directory.
